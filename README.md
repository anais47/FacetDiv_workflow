# FacetDiv_workflow

  + This is the repository for the mini-project I have started with the *Abims bioinformatic plateform* under the supervision of *Erwan Corre*. 

  + **Aim of the mini-project:** Create a workflow providing an integrated view of the diversity (taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity) data obtained with metabarcoding

  + **Duration of the mini-project:** 1 month

  + **Presentation of the mini-project:** for more details see [here](https://anais47.github.io/FacetDiv_workflow/FacetDiv_presentation.pdf) (sorry it is only in french!)

  + **Scripts:** The worfklow is still a *work-in progress* so the entire workflow is not accessible yet. I started to provide few examples of some functions already in the worfklow.
